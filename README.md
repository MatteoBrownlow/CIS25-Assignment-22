==== Assignment 22 README ====
Assignment prompt: Assume that we have a variable that contains someone's full name. Write a program that extract the first and the last name.
This program initializes a string with a first and last name, and loops through the string twice to find the space in between the names as well as the string length.
It passes the string, the element # of the string that contains the space, and the length, and extracts and prints the first and last names.
